Do you like **Google** services? Would you like to bring them at home too? So are we, so this is why we started the deployment of this project. *Google@Home* aim is to let control your home in your own way that could be with android device or for example your voice, with the feature of an easy installation on every kind of embedded device that have GPIO interface and could run *GNU/Linux*.

Would be great to fuse the Google Now functions in your domotic control of the house: the goal is to speak to your home to make google searches, use google now capability and open doors, gates and shutter at the same time.

Picture that:

*Let's suppose that we are an electronic/computer enthusiast that want to enhance our home with some domotics control, but in non-expansive way. Then probably our choice would be to take some RaspberryPi and relay boards, then link the relayboards to the interested points (shutters, lights, dim lights, etc...) we plan to control: maybe a raspberry for floor it's enough, maybe not, but that doesn't matter. Then we install G@H and we can control those points using the voice, web interface, or even mobile device.*

It's just easy as to say *"open shutter"* or a *touch* on your mobile phone.
